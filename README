Using some LaTeX-type formatted files, as the sample files in the "data" directory, this program outputs a CV ready to be compile by LaTeX. To be compile, this CV should use the included style-sheet "resume2.cls". There's also a html view available, with a program cvMakerOnline.rb that uses Sinatra and an index.html to serve the CV online.
